This repo contains most of the information needed to generate the Figures of the paper "An Atlas of the Developing Drosophila Visual System Glia and Subcellular mRNA Localization of Transcripts in Single Cells".

It contains:

R files for the preparation of the larval and adult Drosophila optic lobe glial datasets.

R files for the preparation of all figures.

Table of TFs used.

The final larva, adult and integrated datasets can be found in this Google Docs folder: [To me added after acceptance of paper]

All raw and processed transcriptome data for the larval dataset are available at the GEO under accession number GSE167266. All raw and processed transcriptome data for the adult and pupa stages are at the GEO under GSE142787.
